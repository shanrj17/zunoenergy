## The Hidden Energy Drain

Heat naturally flows from warm to cool areas. In winter, it escapes your home through the roof; in summer, radiant heat from the roof enters your living space.

## Recommended R-Values

Insulation effectiveness is measured by **R-Value**.
- **Cold Climates:** Aim for R-49 to R-60 in the attic.
- **Moderate/Hot Climates:** Aim for R-30 to R-49.

## Types of Insulation

1.  **Fiberglass Batts:** Common, easy to install between joists.
2.  **Blown-In Cellulose:** Excellent for filling gaps and covering existing insulation.
3.  **Spray Foam:** Provides the best air sealing but is more expensive.

## ROI on Insulation

Adding attic insulation typically pays for itself within **3-5 years** through energy savings, while immediately improving home comfort.
