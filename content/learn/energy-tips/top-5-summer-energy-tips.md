## 1. Upgrade Your Thermostat

Smart thermostats learn your schedule and adjust temperatures automatically. This simple switch can save you **10-15%** on cooling costs annually.

## 2. Seal Air Leaks

Window and door drafts let cool air escape. Use weatherstripping or caulk to seal these gaps. It’s one of the cheapest DIY projects with the fastest ROI.

## 3. Use Fans Wisely

Ceiling fans allow you to raise your thermostat setting by about **4°F** with no reduction in comfort. Remember to turn them off when you leave the room—fans cool people, not air.

## 4. Maintain Your HVAC

Replace air filters every 1-3 months. Dirty filters restrict airflow and make your system work harder, using more energy.

## 5. Shade Your Windows

Sunlight streaming through windows adds unwanted heat. Close blinds or drapes during the hottest parts of the day to reduce your AC’s workload.
