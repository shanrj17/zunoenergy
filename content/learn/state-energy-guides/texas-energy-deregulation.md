## What is Energy Deregulation?

In most states, you buy electricity from one utility company. In Texas, the market is **deregulated**, meaning ~85% of residents can choose their Retail Electric Provider (REP).

## How to Shop for Rates

When comparing plans, look beyond the advertised rate per kWh. Pay close attention to:
- **Base Charges:** Fixed monthly fees regardless of usage.
- **Usage Tiers:** Some plans have different rates for <1000 kWh vs >2000 kWh.
- **Contract Term:** Fixed-rate plans protect you from price spikes, while variable-rate plans fluctuate with the market.

## The "Power to Choose"

The official state website, **Power to Choose**, lists available plans. However, be wary of plans with "gimmick" rates that only apply at very specific usage levels.

## Key Takeaway

Deregulation offers choice and competition, but it requires homeowners to be proactive. Review your contract annually to ensure you aren't rolled onto a higher variable rate.
